# sentiment-analysis-of-movie-review-using-nltk
In this code, I use the NLTK library in python for the movie reviews corpus and the bayes classifier to classify movie reviwes into positive or negative categories.

The model trains on a percentage of the pre-existing corpus from the library and then uses the rest of the reviews to test itself on. It then ranks movies in the reviw.

Afterwards it takes the movie review we added into the code and classifies if it is a positive or a negative one.
